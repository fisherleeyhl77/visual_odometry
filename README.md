# Visual odometry using RGBD data

This project implements a visual odometry method based on RGBD data. It also produces the combined point cloud generated by the visual odometry method. 

# Requirements
* CMake > 2.8
* OpenCV 2.4.x
* PCL

# Usages
* Install CMake
* Install OpenCV
* Install Point Cloud Library (PCL)
* Make a config file based on the example (./config.txt)
* mkdir bin
* mkdir -p data/depth_png/
* mkdir -p data/rgb_png/
* Put rgb and depth images to ./data/rgb_png and ./data/depth_png folders
* mkdir results
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* cd ..
* ./bin/visual_odometry ./config.txt ./results/output.pcd
* To see the result, run cd ./results and then run pcl_viewer output.pcd

# Notes
* Visual odometry is an open loop method and the error accumulates as more frames are added. So, it can be used as the front end of a pose graph SLAM algorithm. VO provides inputs to the backend of the SLAM algorithm, where a global optimization method like Levenberg Marquardt (LM) method can be used to globally adjust all the poses to optimally fit the data.
